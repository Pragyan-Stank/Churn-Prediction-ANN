# Churn Prediction using Artificial Neural Network (ANN)

Here's the streamlit app: https://churn-prediction-ann-bbg8ceetxb7teqvrmkpudv.streamlit.app/

## 📌 Project Overview
This project predicts whether a customer is likely to **churn** (leave a service) based on their data.  
The model is built using an **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)** and trained on a labeled dataset.

## 🚀 Features
- Data preprocessing (encoding, scaling)
- ANN model creation using **TensorFlow/Keras**
- Model training and evaluation
- Churn prediction on new data

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Python**
- **TensorFlow / Keras**
- **NumPy**
- **Pandas**
- **Tensorboard** (for visualization)


## 📊 Dataset
The dataset contains customer-related features such as:
- Demographics (age, gender, etc.)
- Account details (tenure, balance, etc.)
- Service details (products, subscriptions, etc.)
- Target variable: **Exited** (1 = churn, 0 = stay)
